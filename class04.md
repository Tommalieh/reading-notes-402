## database

### A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.

## Schema

### A schema in a SQL database is a collection of logical structures of data. The schema is owned by a database user and has the same name as the database user. From SQL Server 2005, a schema is an independent entity (container of objects) different from the user who creates that object

## Record

### A record in a database is an object that can contain one or more values. Groups of records are then saved in a table; the table defines the data that each record may contain. In a given database, there are multiple tables, each containing multiple records.

## SQL
