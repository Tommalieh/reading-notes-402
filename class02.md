## Test Driven Development (TDD)

### Test-driven development is a balanced approach for the programming perfectly blended with tightly interwoven three activities: coding, testing (writing unit tests) and designing (refactoring).

### advantages to Test Driven Development:

1-  Prompt Feedback: The streamlined TDD process helps the project development team members to improve their delivering capability because of providing the immediate feedback on the developed components.

2- The Best Level Acceptance: TDD implementation helps the developers to understand the requirements from the perspective experience of clients.

3- Extended Modulation for Small Units: TDD helps to create better modularized, extensible and flexible code.

## The BeforeEach and AfterEach

### Commands allow you to define setup and teardown tasks that are performed at the beginning and end of every It block. This can eliminate duplication of code in test scripts, ensure that each test is performed on a pristine state regardless of their order, and perform any necessary cleanup tasks after each test.

## ES6 Classes VS prototypes

### The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

## Static methods 

### Static methods are called without instantiating their class and are also not callable when the class is instantiated. Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.

## Pure functions

### Pure functions are functions that accept an input and returns a value without modifying any data outside its scope(Side Effects). Its output or return value must depend on the input/arguments
