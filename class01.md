# NPM

### npm is the world’s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

### npm consists of three distinct components:

1- the website.

2- the Command Line Interface (CLI).

3- the registry.

## Why we use NPM?

- Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.

- Download standalone tools you can use right away.

- Run packages without downloading using npx.

- Share code with any npm user, anywhere.

- Restrict code to specific developers.

- Create Orgs (organizations) to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.

- Form virtual teams by using Orgs.

- Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.

- Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.

- Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.

- Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

## Interpreter 

### Interpreter is a program that reads and executes code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts. Common interpreters include Perl, Python, and Ruby interpreters, which execute Perl, Python, and Ruby code respectively Interpreters bypass the compilation process and execute the code directly.

## Compiler

### Compiler is a program that translates source code into object code. The compiler derives its name from the way it works, looking at the entire piece of source code and collecting and reorganizing the instructions.

## Server

### A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. ... For example, a Web server may run Apache HTTP Server or Microsoft IIS, which both provide access to websites over the Internet. A mail server may run a program like Exim or iMail, which provides SMTP services for sending and receiving email.

## Environment 

### The term environment refers to the state of a computer, determined by a combination of software, basic hardware, and which programs are running.

## V8
