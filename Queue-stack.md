## Stack

### A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

## Common terminology for a stack :

1- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

2- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

3- Top - This is the top of the stack.

4- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

5- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### Stack's concepts

- LIFO : Last In First Out.

- FILO : First In Last Out.

## Queue

### Queue is a linear data structure where the first element is inserted from one end called REAR and deleted from the other end called as FRONT.In a queue, one end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to delete data (dequeue), because queue is open at both its ends.

## Common terminology for a queue:

1- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

2- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

3- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

4- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

5- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

6- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### queue's concepts

- FIFO : First In First Out.

- LILO : Last In Last Out.
