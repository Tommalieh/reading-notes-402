## router.param(name, callback)

### Adds callback triggers to route parameters, where name is the name of the parameter and callback is the callback function. Although name is technically optional, using this method without it is deprecated starting with Express v4.11.0.

## router.route(path)

### Returns an instance of a single route which you can then use to handle HTTP verbs with optional middleware. Use router.route() to avoid duplicate route naming and thus typing errors.
